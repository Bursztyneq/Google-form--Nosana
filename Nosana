Hello team Nosana! 

I want to inform that I made a mistake with Solana address wallet in a google form. First form has my different address wallet. 

This address is correct: GoELSp69ZCzWA9BJiQaQkFcwbCn1FS983XUofFpXPNJ

Sorry about that and thanks for participate in this strong project!

All the best!
